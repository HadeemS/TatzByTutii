            Hey lovies — my name is Jazmine Tutii, but I&apos;m more known as Tutii. I am a Columbia-based tattoo artist
            known for detailed compositions and custom designs created in collaboration with each client.
          </p>
          <p className="about__text">
            With professional shop experience and an academic background in psychology, art, business, and African
            American history, my approach to tattooing blends technical precision with meaningful visual storytelling.
          </p>
          <p className="about__text">
            Each piece is designed with attention to flow, balance, and individuality, ensuring artwork complements both
            the concept and the natural movement of the body.
          </p>
          <p className="about__text">
            Operating from a home-based private studio environment allows for a focused and comfortable experience where
            clients can feel confident throughout the entire process — from consultation to completed tattoo.
